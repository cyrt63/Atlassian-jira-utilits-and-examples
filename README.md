This set of libraries contain code that is useful to Atlassian Plugins.

Its first incarnation is all about JIRA plugins.  The reason for this is that it was JIRA based teams that
first created this set of libraries.

Time will tell if it expands out into more useful things for other types of Atlassian Plugins.

The idea behind the library set is to have a set of "targeted" libraries that do specific jobs.

We don't want any individual library to become a ghetto of code not do we want complex interdependency's between the libraries.
